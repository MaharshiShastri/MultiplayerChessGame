This was a joint collaboration between RonitBoi and MaharshiShastri inorder recreate chess multiplayer online game. The game is coded in Python 3.10.10 version and utilises many user defined as well as pre-defined
libraries to perform basic chess operations and recording login details and a history of moves made within the game. Modules board, color, config, const, dragger, game, main, move, piece sound, square theme was written
and debugged by RonitBoi(https://github.com/RonitBoi). Modules CreateTable, history, login, Menu and update was written and debugged by MaharshiShastri(https://github.com/MaharshiShastri). This is but a simple example
of a simple chess game. The prowess of python is the extensive collection of libraries from connecting and performing opearations on databases to calling AWS resources to making games(pygame library). Python is the future,
the sooner you learn its libraries, the better your chances at software development. 

Note: I am not promoting AWS in any form, but I have used Amazon WebServices' GameFleet to perform multiplayer session based game. It requires you to create an executable(instructions will be written in instruction.txt)

This is it! Hope you can rate us or provide us with feedback or fork this to your project ðŸ˜Š
